## Single Queue
is a linear structure which follows a particular order (FIFO) in which the operations are performed.

## Applications of Queue :
* Semaphores
* FCFS (first come first serve) scheduling algorithm
* Buffer for devices

## Functions implemented :
* **EnQueue** : Adds an item in the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be a Queue Overflow.
* **DeQueue** : Removes an item from the queue. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Empty Queue.
* **IsFull** : Returns True if the queue is Full, else False (Note : queue implementation using linked list has no Isfull function as it is dynamic memory allocation).
* **IsEmpty** : Returns True if the queue is Empty, else False.
