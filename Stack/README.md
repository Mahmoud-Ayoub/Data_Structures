is a linear data structure which follows a particular order (LIFO) in which the operations are performed 

## Applications of Stack 
* Memory Management
* Context Switch handle
* Infix to Postfix

## Functions implemented 
* **Push** : Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be a Stack Overflow.
* **Pop** : Removes an item from the stack. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Empty Stack.
* **IsFull** : Returns True if the stack is Full, else False (*Note : stack implementation using linked list has no Isfull function as it is dynamic memory allocation*).
* **IsEmpty** : Returns True if the stack is Empty, else False.
